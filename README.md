1. Logic Gates:
    1. Summary / Fundamentals:
        * Logic gates such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR, are the core building blocks of Robotics, they deal with binary inputs to produce an output using logical operations. Logic Gates deal with the vast majority of logical operations in technology and can be found almost everywhere.
