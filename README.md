   * Explain the design process:
   * Constraints and implications for decision-making:
   * Explains technology theories, concepts, and principles and describes the properties of materials, data, or systems to address a need, problem, or challenge:
   * Thinks critically, drawing on data and information to solve problems:

1. Logic Gates:
    1. Summary / Fundamentals:
        * Logic gates such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR, are the core building blocks of Robotics, they deal with binary inputs to produce an output using logical operations. Logic Gates deal with the vast majority of logical operations in technology and can be found almost everywhere.
          
        * AND gates: The AND gate takes in two binary inputs, the amount can be adjusted depending on the usage case. The output will only be HIGH(1) if all inputs are also HIGH(1) otherwise the output will be LOW(0). An Example of this is circuits that require multiple conditions to be met at the same time in order for another operation to be made. AND gates can be found in a lot of real-world machines, an example of this is the dough ball machine at my job, this machine requires all panels that can access the insides of the machine to be closed at the same time for the machine to turn on, this is an example of an AND gate that has more than two inputs as there are three panels that can be opened, this is important as the machine has a knife to cut the dough balls to size and if the panel is open then a person could easily stick their hand into the machine and get their fingers chopped off making it a safety hazard.
