# [Assignment 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LIhUYkaf867kwXQBt9mHuq_mbfdXFZp5bEwa1eQIe9M/edit?usp=sharing) (Fusion-360)
  * The task for this assignment was to make a 3D-Model of a puzzle that could go into an escape room, for this I had to learn how to use Fusion-360 and how to measure using a caliper.
    
  * This was the first assignment in which I had to use a design process, I started with planning what the project would be and then I started working on it, this was a massive oversight on my part as I should have got some feedback on my planning before starting on the project.
    
  * I needed to incorporate my lack of knowledge into my design's complexity as I was not able to fully complete it. 
    
  * 3D-Modeling is an important skill and I used this skill to get a digital, visual representation of what my prototype was going to look like, this skill was very new to me as I had never touched a 3D-Modeling software before this and this meant that my 3D-Model had loads of issues.
    
  * Even if I am not the one 3D-Modeling something this skill can be useful to view 3D-Models and understand what is going on, knowing Fusion-360 is also a vital skill in the robotics industry as it can be used to export various file types which are used to laser cut, 3D print or CNC, and more.
    
  * If I could redo this assignment I would work more on my 3D-modeling skills while doing the assignment, as I did not put much personal time into learning the 3D-Modeling software and this caused me to fall behind and not finish the model.

# [Assignment 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jk0fSGwwOLpr9i07WvMMjKFnM6h-2lXJJdnnV7qE2yY/edit?usp=sharing) (Prototyping)
  * **What the assignment was and what I learnt from it** The goal of this assignment was to make a prototype using the 3D-Model from [Assignment 2 (Fusion-360)](#Assignment-2), I had to make a parts list so they could be ordered which taught me a bit about what electronic parts I should be looking for. The main part that I learn was wiring up the various parts and linking them together in code.
    
  * <a href="url"><img src="robotics evidence.jpg" align="right" height="427" width="427" ></a>**Explain the design process** I did not start with planning because this assignment was based on [Assignment 2 (Fusion-360)](#Assignment-2) which was the planning, so I got straight to work on the project and after making it functional I did some testing with friends that were over at my house and applied the necessary tweaks.
    
  * Due to [Assignment 2 (Fusion-360)](#Assignment-2) being less than ideal, it did affect this assignment quite critically and so because of this constraint I decided to laser cut my prototype, this was also faster and taught me a bit about using [Hackerspace](https://boxes.hackerspace-bamberg.de/Console2?language=en). There was also a supply issue and none of our parts were ordered, this meant I had to change a lot of my project and basically ended up changing the entire concept of the project.

  * These skills are very adaptable to future assignments or personal robotics projects because prototyping is a core component of robotics, it allows the maker to make what they want without fully committing to the project meaning if it doesn't turn out well starting again isn't too much of a hassle. From this point onwards I will make a prototype of every project before committing to the final project, having to rip everything apart because it didn't turn out well is gut-wrenching and I'd like to avoid it, thankfully this assignment has taught me how to stop doing that.
    
  *  I don't think I could have changed much of the outcome due to the sudden lack of parts due to a logistics issue, however, I would have liked to have put more thought into my puzzle because, in the end, that was what got my grade marked down a bit. The puzzle was a bit incomplete and was really hard to work out without instructions, as you can see in the image I had to put paper notes explaining how to do various parts of the puzzle due to it being unintuitive.

# [Assignment 4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AUkccOJvTg26qP0JidxsnGPb405F-uH-OYcI0rLjJEU/edit?usp=sharing) (Logic-Gates)
  * The goal of this assignment was to make a circuit with at least two logic gates using no code, this taught me a lot about transistors and gave me a better understanding of how logic gates actually work even in code, I also had to worry about resistance issues and learn ohms law, this assignment has definitely taught me the most new information.
    
  * I started off by finding what I wanted to make, and then I made a prototype in [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com) which had a fair share of issues however I got it mostly working and moved onto making the physical version, however, I realised too late on that my project would not actually be my original idea and instead became a variant of the original circuit I was trying to make, this is due to poor planning, after finishing the physical version I wrote my documentation and then got feedback and did some editing.
    
  * A major constraint I had when deciding what circuit I wanted to make was time, despite knowing how to make each gate individually when putting them together in sequence a lot of issues arose and I had to spend a lot of time troubleshooting which sucked away time from documentation and made my project a lot less complex. I also ran out of some resistors and had to figure out a way to make the project work with the wrong resistors, however, I did drive to [Jaycar](https://www.jaycar.com.au) to pick up some 1k ohm resistors however this cost me a lot of time as well and I still did not have many 10k ohm resistors.
    
  * The knowledge of logic gates and truth tables can be really useful for coding, for me coding is my best skill and upgrading that skill to a further degree is always welcome, it is good for coding because working out complex problems can be as simple as making a truth table and then reverse engineering the truth table into logic gates then converting that into if statements, this is useful for all circuits that require code as a skill but this knowledge can also be used for primitive logic gates if needed.
    
  * If I could redo this assignment I would have planned the right circuit from the start, which was the Gated SR-Latch, this in turn, would have resulted in me planning my entire project properly on tinkercad allowing for simple conversion from digital to physical circuit, and despite various issues that, that conversion might have it still would have been a lot easier to work with rather than scrapping my project multiple times and ultimately switching circuits which wasted A LOT of time.
