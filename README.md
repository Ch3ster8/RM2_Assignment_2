# [Assignment 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LIhUYkaf867kwXQBt9mHuq_mbfdXFZp5bEwa1eQIe9M/edit?usp=sharing) (Fusion-360)
  * **What the assignment was and what I learnt from it** The task for this assignment was to make a 3D-Model of a puzzle that could go into an escape room, for this I had to learn how to use Fusion-360 and how to measure using a caliper.
    
  * **Explain the design process** This was the first assignment in which I had to use a design process, I started with planning what the project would be and then I started working on it, this was a massive oversight on my part as I should have got some feedback on my planning before starting on the project.
    
  * **Constraints for decision making** I needed to incorporate my lack of knowledge into my design's complexity as I was not able to fully complete it. 
    
  * **How I used these skills** 3D-Modeling is an important skill and I used this skill to get a digital, visual representation of what my prototype was going to look like, this skill was very new to me as I had never touched a 3D-Modeling software before this and this meant that my 3D-Model had loads of issues.
    
  * **How to use these skills in the future** Even if I am not the one 3D-Modeling something this skill can be useful to view 3D-Models and understand what is going on, knowing Fusion-360 is also a vital skill in the robotics industry as it can be used to export various file types which are used to laser cut, 3D print or CNC, and more.
    
  * **If I could redo this assignment** If I could redo this assignment I would work more on my 3D-modeling skills while doing the assignment, as I did not put much personal time into learning the 3D-Modeling software and this caused me to fall behind and not finish the model.

# [Assignment 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jk0fSGwwOLpr9i07WvMMjKFnM6h-2lXJJdnnV7qE2yY/edit?usp=sharing) (Prototyping)
  * **What the assignment was and what I learnt from it** The goal of this assignment was to make a prototype using the 3D-Model from [Assignment 2 (Fusion-360)](#Assignment-2), I had to make a parts list so they could be ordered which taught me a bit about what electronic parts I should be looking for. The main part that I learn was wiring up the various parts and linking them together in code.
    
  * <a href="url"><img src="robotics evidence.jpg" align="right" height="427" width="427" ></a>**Explain the design process** I did not start with planning because this assignment was based on [Assignment 2 (Fusion-360)](#Assignment-2) which was the planning, so I got straight to work on the project and after making it functional I did some testing with friends that were over at my house and applied the necessary tweaks.
    
  * **Constraints for decision making** Due to [Assignment 2 (Fusion-360)](#Assignment-2) being less than ideal, it did affect this assignment quite critically and so because of this constraint I decided to laser cut my prototype, this was also faster and taught me a bit about using [Hackerspace](https://boxes.hackerspace-bamberg.de/Console2?language=en). There was also a supply issue and none of our parts were ordered, this meant I had to change a lot of my project and basically ended up changing the entire concept of the project.
    
  * **How I used these skills** 
    
  * **How to use these skills in the future**
    
  *  **If I could redo this assignment** I don't think I could have changed much of the outcome due to the sudden lack of parts due to a logistics issue, however, I would have liked to have put more thought into my puzzle because, in the end, that was what got my grade marked down a bit. The puzzle was a bit incomplete and was really hard to work out without instructions, as you can see in the image I had to put paper notes explaining how to do various parts of the puzzle due to it being unintuitive.
