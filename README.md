# Assignment 2 (Fusion-360)
  * **What the assignment was and what I learnt from it** The task for this assignment was to make a 3D-Model of a puzzle that could go into an escape room, for this I had to learn how to use Fusion-360 and how to measure using a caliper.
    
  * **Explain the design process** This was the first assignment in which I had to use a design process, I started with planning what the project would be and then I started working on it, this was a massive oversight on my part as I should have got some feedback on my planning before starting on the project.
    
  * **Constraints for decision making** I needed to incorporate my lack of knowledge into my design's complexity as I was not able to fully complete it. 
    
  * **How I used these skills** 3D-Modeling
    
  * **How to use these skills in the future**
    
  * **If I could redo this assignment**
